### What's SerialDate in Java
SerialDate is the Java Class Date. About the Author:
```
Sometimes java.util.Date is *too* precise - it represents a moment, to the 1/1000th 
of a second (the date itself depends on the time zone). 
Sometimes we just want to represent a particular day 
(for example, January 21, 2015) without worrying about the time, time zone or other parameters. 
That's why we defined SerialDate.
